# apcsa_final_project
You, a gardener, are working on your garden (a grid of flowerbeds). There is no winning or losing except with your pride and ego. You can buy flowers with the coins you gain as the days pass. Your flowers will lose water value as the days pass and you must water them. You may end the game early if you like.
